# Embrary

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
This is an application that mimicks a library database front end (kind of). It was built mostly as a way to learn ember 
and test out its features.

### Running Tests

These dont really do much as of right now but they may later on if I try to get them to work.

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

server
